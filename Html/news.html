            Yellen says visit helps put US-China ties on 'surer footing'

          <div class="news-description">
            BEIJING, China — US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday that her talks with top Chinese officials
            have helped put ties on "surer footing", as she wrapped up a trip aimed at stabilising fraught relations
            between the two biggest economies. <br>
            During her four-day trip -- which came on the heels of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit --
            Yellen stressed the need for healthy economic competition and improved communication, and urged cooperation
            on the grave threat posed by climate change. <br>
            "And on both sides, the sentiment that was expressed is that the world is big enough for both of our
            countries to thrive, to cooperate on shared global challenges, to have a meaningful economic relationship
            and that we needed to stabilise our relationship to make sure that we were able to accomplish that," Yellen
            said in an interview with CBS

            Phivolcs: Mayon Volcano pyroclastic density currents now more frequent

          <div class="news-description">
            Pyroclastic density currents or PDCs are made up of fragmented volcanic particles, gases, and ash that
            travel down volcanic slopes at high speeds<br>
            MANILA, Philippines – State volcanologists observed an increase in the frequency of pyroclastic density
            currents (PDCs) from Mayon Volcano in Albay, which started late Sunday afternoon, July 9.<br>
            PDCs are made up of fragmented volcanic particles, gases, and ash that travel down volcanic slopes at high
            speeds.<br>
            The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said in an advisory at 8 am on Monday,
            July 10, that there have been 33 PDCs since 5 pm, Sunday.<br>
            These PDCs were “generated by dome collapse from Mayon Volcano’s summit crater and the collapsing front and
            margins of the advancing lava flows on the upper to middle slopes.”<br>

            MANILA, Philippines — The offices of House Speaker Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez and Tingog Party-list Rep.
            Yedda Marie K. Romualdez will facilitate the distribution of relief items to families affected by a fire in
            Cotabato City. <br>
            Around 200 families were affected by the fire that broke out in Purok Tadman, Poblacion 7, and damaged
            around 80 houses last July 5. <br>
            Following the fire, Tingog Party-list Cotabato brought 250 packed meals and 80 gallons of water to victims
            who were temporarily sheltered at the Datu Siang Elementary School.<br>
            Romualdez said that his office and Tingog Party-list were planning to distribute relief goods under the
            Department of Social Welfare and Development Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations (AICS) to the

            As the fighting continues in Sudan, we are stepping up support for the growing number of people fleeing to
            neighbouring countries.<br>
            Yesterday, we released US$8 million from the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund to help refugees and returnees
            from Sudan who are seeking shelter in South Sudan. The funds will help organizations on the ground provide
            food, water, shelter and medical care to those affected by the ongoing violence. Some 150,000 people have
            been recorded arriving in South Sudan since the conflict in Sudan erupted on 15 April – and that number is
            expected to increase as the crisis continues.<br>
            This week, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Martin Griffiths, also allocated $5 million
            from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support new arrivals in Ethiopia. That money will help
            met the needs of about 100,000 people for six months. Humanitarian partners are providing water, health,
            protection assistance, and other essential services. More than 60,000 people have crossed into Ethiopia
            since the onset of the crisis in Sudan.

            Sarah Silverman sues Meta, OpenAI for copyright infringement
          </div>
          <div class="news-description">
            Comedian Sarah Silverman and two authors have filed copyright infringement lawsuits against Meta Platforms
            and OpenAI for allegedly using their content without permission to train artificial intelligence language
            models.<br>
            The proposed class action lawsuits filed by Silverman, Richard Kadrey and Christopher Golden in San
            Francisco federal court Friday allege Facebook parent company Meta and ChatGPT maker OpenAI used copyrighted
            material to train chat bots.<br>
            Meta and OpenAI, a private company backed by Microsoft Corp, did not immediately respond to requests for
            comment on Sunday.<br>
            The lawsuits underscore the legal risks developers of chat bots face when using troves of copyrighted
            material to create apps that deliver realistic responses to user prompts.

            Meralco hints at rate cut in July
          </div>
          <div class="news-description">
            Power distributor Manila Electric Co (Meralco) on Tuesday said there is a large possibility that power rates
            may be adjusted downward as oil prices go down.<br>
            Meralco spokesman Joe Zaldarriaga noted stabilization of consumption patterns could also lead to a rate
            adjustment. <br>
            "Tapos na yung summer months, nasa tag-ulan na tayo so nagiging stable na ang kuryente," he told TeleRadyo
            Serbisyo, adding that he will make an announcement next month.<br>
            Power rates in June went up by P0.4183 per kWh after the completion of the distribution-related refund. In a
            statement, the utility distributor said there would be an upward adjustment of P0.4183 per kWh in the
            electricity rate this month, bringing the overall rate for a typical household to P11.9112 per kWh from
            May's P11.4929 per kWh.
