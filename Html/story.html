    <div class="story">There she was, trembling. With a bottleneck in hand, she started to approach a small house in the
      distance, where she saw the criminal take her brother. It had no neighboring houses. It stood alone in the heart
      of the forest. The house was very old, with masses of creeping plants surrounding it. The lilac-colored flowers
      enveloped the walls, windows, even the stone path leading to the residence. There were shattered windows and
      broken, wooden handrails near the entrance. The walls of the house had blackened due to events that took place
      in the long run. The old roof was the only thing that protected it. But it too was beginning to disintegrate. The
      pleasant smell of mint was roaming through the air. A cloud of faint smoke can be witnessed as a result of the
      burnt plants that gave fog to the environment. There was a fallen kerosene lamp near the burnt plants. Seems
      like there was a commotion that occurred before she arrived.

    <div class="story">
      With blood trickling down her thigh, every step felt like daggers repeatedly stabbed onto her wound.
      “Pain” was exactly the word that described what she felt. But at this moment, all she felt was hatred,
      frustration,
      and vengeance. She quietly walked past the white and lilac flowers that bloomed with the plants of the rotten
      house. The place looked quite familiar for it had the same color and design as their home. The only difference is
      that it’s worn out and possibly a thousand-year older. But she didn’t pay attention because as she drew near, she
      quickly found what she was looking for. From the window, she saw her brother playing by the fireplace like a
      peaceful kid. She was relieved at the sight of the child. She didn’t know what she’d do if she found him injured.

    <div class="story">
      SNAP! A broken branch was heard from a distance. There were light footsteps on the grass. Someone
      was approaching from behind and she knew it was the criminal. She did not think twice. When the criminal was
      about to grab her from behind, she rapidly turned and stabbed the person’s right leg using the broken bottleneck.
      The person cried in agony. She knew she really inflicted a huge laceration on their leg. She saw this as an
      opportunity to get her brother back. Hurriedly, she climbed up the broken window to fetch her brother leaving
      her weapon on the criminal’s leg. However, she failed to notice that the windowpane had chunks of piercing
      glass left. As she quickly climbed through, the glass was caught on her porcelain skin earning her a big cut to
      the thigh. She screamed at the top of her lungs. Blood gushed out and she felt like all the pain in the world
      belonged to her. But it didn’t matter. What mattered most was her sibling. She must save her brother as soon as
      possible. She grabbed her brother and ran to the hallway leading to the bedroom adjacent to the living room.
      The little child was cold and still. She held her brother much closer to her assuming that she had been gone for
      too long hence leaving her brother alone and scared. Much to her surprise, she knew where to hide. The
      criminal was infuriated as he saw the girl fleeing, taking her sibling with her. The bad guy screamed as he
      followed her, still desperate to catch the girl. As he took a step forward, he slipped in the pool of blood caused
      by the girl’s bleeding, hitting his head on the stone table.

      Meanwhile, As she was beginning to get weak, she chose to hide her brother under the bed. “Hide
      under here.” She told him. “And don’t go anywhere unless you hear me scream. Okay?” She ordered her brother
      and gave him a kiss on his cold forehead. “I know you’re scared and that’s why you’re cold. But I need you to
      trust me, okay?” She paused, hearing a loud bang from the living room. “I’ll be back” She assured her brother.
      He didn’t respond and just lay there waiting for his sister.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="story">
      She, on the other hand, thought of eliminating the criminal so she left her brother hiding under the bed.
She slowly advanced toward the bedroom door and peeked through the hallway. There she saw a big
grandfather clock on the left side of the hallway. She didn’t notice that it was there before. Immediately, she saw
the criminal laying on the ground. She quickly grabbed the revolver that was placed at the table near the door
and proceeded toward where the criminal was. She still trembled as she approached the criminal. She was
enraged yet satisfied that finally, it will all be over. “DIE!” She screamed expressing the rage in her tone. She
gave it all in one blow to the head. The grandfather clock chimed in time after she pulled the trigger. It rang so
loud that it enveloped the sound of the gunshot.

    <div class="story">
      She quickly woke up from the nightmare and was relieved it was all a dream. Then there was a sharp
      pain in her leg. It wasn’t a dream. Beside her was her brother, already lifeless. It was why he wasn’t responding.
      The criminal already killed the boy before she even arrived. She hallucinated and got unconscious on the floor
      because of blood loss. The flowers made her hallucinate. It was her brother who hit the kerosene lamp while
      struggling in the arms of the criminal causing a fire to breakthrough, enough to burn just a portion of the Salvia
      Divinorum. Her eyes quickly searched for a clock on the wall. It read 11:59 as she heard the word “Die.” before
      hearing the grandfather clock chime in the distance for the last time in her life.
